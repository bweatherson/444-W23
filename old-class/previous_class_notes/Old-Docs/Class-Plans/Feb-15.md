# Start with probabilities

Update by conditionalisation

# Do we do AGM? Probably not.

* But two big puzzles
* One is update on 'impossible' evidence
* Other is contraction
* Arguably one solution will work for both
* Impossible update = contraction plus update
* That's contentious - not obviously a definition - but plausble

# Like-mindedness

* Common prior
* That's what we end up with

# What Aumann's theory states

* If there is a common prior, and it is common knowledge what the posteriors are, the posteriors must be equal.

# Other versions of Aumann

* Can't have common knowledge of expectation
* Can't have common knowledge of which side of expectation
* Can have common knowledge of non-agreement on expectation (including probability)
* Can't have common knowledge of average of probabilities!
* Can't have common knowledge of action, given common action plan and common prior - but this is tricky, and requires some strong assumptions about plans - in particular requires a strong version of Sure Thing Principle
* No trade theorems (though these are a bit boring)

# Need common prior

* Trivial to get counterexamples without it
* Just have no information, and distinct priors and done
* I mean, it's a bit tougher than that, but that's roughly the idea

# What about with just S4

* That's trickier, because don't often have perfect knowledge of own probability!
* But what if you do?
* I don't know. Sob. Sob.
