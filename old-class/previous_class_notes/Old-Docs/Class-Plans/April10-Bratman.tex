\section{Three Conditions}
\label{threeconditions}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Mutual Responsiveness

\item{} Commitment to joint activity

\item{} Commitment to mutual support

\end{itemize}
Really needs last - otherwise competitive activities are SCAs, and so is mob violence

\section{Can I intend that we F?}
\label{caniintendthatwef}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Sure - I can intend to spend a sunny day at the beach, without intending the sunshine

\item{} I can even, I think, do it without being 100\% sure of the sunshine

\item{} Don't need complete control

\end{itemize}
\section{Cooperative stability}
\label{cooperativestability}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Is this right - do we have to have this?

\item{} I guess so - driving around a roundabout is sort of like this

\item{} Can be responsive - and intend that we both get by - and have no intent to support

\end{itemize}
\section{What exactly counts as coercion?}
\label{whatexactlycountsascoercion}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Yes if I dictate the terms

\item{} No, I guess, if I have limits - RickRolling example

\end{itemize}
\section{What does coercion stop}
\label{whatdoescoercionstop}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Shared intention

\item{} Or shared cooperative activity

\item{} I don't know - feels a bit like joint intention still

\end{itemize}
\section{Explicit disavowal of commitment}
\label{explicitdisavowalofcommitment}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Discuss these for a bit

\item{} Do they defeat shared intention; shared cooperative activity?

\item{} Do they

\end{itemize}
\section{Can we get commitment from elsewhere}
\label{canwegetcommitmentfromelsewhere}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Typical case - assurances and responsibility to live up to assurances

\item{} Big picture - let people know what game they are playing

\item{} Let people rule out options

\item{} This is a good thing to do

\end{itemize}
