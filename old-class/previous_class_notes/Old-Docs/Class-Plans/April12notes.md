# Question One

* How the cases get going
* Ways to prevent problem - institutional; educational
* What to say about design? (Will things be thwarted if people can trade out)
* Is it even a problem if people do simply trade out - what does this say about liberalism

# Question Two

* A bunch of different cases to consider
* Conjunction cases (army, operations manual)
* Stored in collective but not individual memory cases (like Bird's example)
* Institutional belief (but Ruritanian communist party is problem)
* Wishful thinking cases (Lackey alludes to this)
* Lackey's argument about action - worth spelling out the steps clearly and how each of these cases interacts with the argument

# Question Three

* Motivating the obligation
* Clarifying the obligation (is it to continue, to not discontinue without notice etc)
* What type of obligation (prudential, moral, sui generis)
* Can it be explained away - e.g., group action requires a promise, and promises imply obligation?
* What to say about cases of explicit disavowal
* What to say about cases of immoral group activity
