# Group Beliefs

1. Literally, a group belief, e.g., a group report.
2. Deferral to group of experts who don't all agree
3. Deferral to peers

# The Puzzle

* Majority opinions aren't closed under logical entailment.
* Indeed, can have $p$, $q$ and $\neg (p \wedge q)$.
* If you have three propositions, you can have unanimity of negated conjunction, and majority for each conjunct.

# Solution One - Talk it Out

* In reality, you should always talk through these puzzles.
* Why this is so is a bit interesting, and maybe will come back to.

# Solution Two - Set an Agenda

* Fix some things to decide upon, and take questions to be settled once they are entailed by things that are decided.
* But then the order of operations will matter.
* And very big question - should the order be set externally or internally.
* An external setting is where we decide before seeing the questions what we'll do
* An internal setting is where we take the opinions to determine the order
* So settle the unanimous ones first is a kind of internal setting.

# How we do this in Practice

* Really totally varies.
* Not even clear how we should do it.
* Worth thinking through some examples

# Experts

* In practice, we don't want to defer equally to each person.
* We want to defer to the physics experts on physics, the hockey experts on hockey, etc.
* The problem is, this turns out to be hard when there are propositions about both.
* This will relate to another problem, but here's the basic idea
* We have to solve various problems about conjunction.
* If they agree the problems are independent, then easy.
* If they agree the problems are dependent, it is sort of like a peer question.
* Imagine one of them thinks the questions are linked, the other does not.
* How do we determine what to do?

# Probability

* Linear averaging solves a lot of problems
* The linear average of a bunch of probability functions is a probability function.
* Hooray, but wait a minute
* Problem about experts
* Problem about independence

# Expert Problem

| Prop |  A  |  B  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| p&q  |  0  |  0  |
| p&~q | 0.6 | 0.2 |
| ~p&q | 0.2 | 0.6 |
| ~p&~q| 0.2 | 0.2 |

* If you settle the unanimous questions first, you end up with a weird view on $p, q$
* Make A expert on $p$, B expert on $q$; both think the prop they are expert on is more likely than not, but hard to see rule that gets you to that result.

# Independence Problem
