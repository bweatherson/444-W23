Plan for Monday, March 20

0. What we aggregate
1. Gibbard's paradox
2. Independence paradox - what on earth to do
3. Competing experts
4. Discursive dilemma
5. Experts version of discursive dilemma
6. Manipulability and independence. Anything other than independence allows that group can go from disagreeing with X to agreeing with X when X changes their vote to be insincere.
6a. Unaninimity rule/Oligarch rule.
6b. Super (or superduper) majority rule. Can be enough.
7. General version - pick an agenda. But who decides? Will agenda solve things?
8. Solution one - argue about premises (but who picks them)
9. Solution two - keep working through things until a question is settled
10. Solution three - settle the unanimous ones first, and then use sequential
11. Use a distance metric - jellybeans. But what is the metric? Can't be all propositions - everything is equidistant. Note that this gives a version of the insincerity result.

# Competing Experts Example

Prop |  A  |  B  |
p&q  |  0  |  0  |
p&~q | 0.6 | 0.2 |
~p&q | 0.2 | 0.6 |
~p&~q| 0.2 | 0.2 |

Straight averaging is easy, and relatively plausible
Make A an expert on p, B an expert on q
If we agree with unanimous judgments on four-way, can't agree with others

# Another Experts example

Prop |  A   |  B   |
p&q  | 0.81 | 0.09 |
p&~q | 0.09 | 0.09 |
~p&q | 0.01 | 0.01 |
~p&~q| 0.09 | 0.81 |

A expert on p; B expert on q
Following expertise leads to p & ~q. But they both think that's unlikely. Can't agree with unanimous recommendation.


What we aggregate

* Beliefs
* Credences
* What-to-do
* Preferences
* Values
* Intentions

General Puzzle

* There are rational constraints both within kinds, and across kinds
* Natural one-by-one rules don't preserve those constraints

Examples

* Discursive dilemma
* Independence of independent events
* Arrow's Paradox

Extra Puzzle

* If we give special weight to some people on some questions, there are brutal borderline issues
* Sen's paradox is a version of this puzzle
* But expertise puzzles also make this puzzle arise
