<h1 id="informationsets">Information sets</h1>

<ul>
<li>Sets of nodes that player doesn&#8217;t know which they are at</li>
<li>Gotta have same choices available</li>
<li>None is predecessor of the other</li>
<li>Perfect recall: her prior moves are same at each node</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="howtorepresentchoicefollowedbystrategicgame">How to represent choice followed by strategic game</h1>

<ul>
<li>Two natural choices</li>
<li>Actually a third choice, which is a bit of a pain</li>
<li>Feels like a hack, and sort of is</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="strategies">Strategies</h1>

<ul>
<li> A choice for each information set</li>
<li> This is a generalisation of what we previously had</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="subgame">Subgame</h1>

<ul>
<li>Only singleton nodes launch subgames</li>
<li>Every successor of the launch node must not &#8216;cut&#8217; info set</li>
<li>That is, no successor is in info set with non-successor</li>
<li>See example on page 110</li>
<li>This matters for definition of SPE</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="spe">SPE</h1>

<ul>
<li>Strategy set is Nash in whole game and every subgame</li>
<li>Incredible threats are not SPEs</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="speandsequentialrationality">SPE and sequential rationality</h1>

<ul>
<li> Consider a game where A moves, then B, but B isn&#8217;t told A&#8217;s move</li>
<li> And what B would do is dominated (draw example of this b4 class)</li>
<li> Well, B is irrational</li>
<li> But that could be SPE (if A never goes where B dominated)</li>
<li> Feels like we need more</li>
<li> We&#8217;ll get to this</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="chancemoves">Chance moves</h1>

<ul>
<li>Need a basic story about probability</li>
<li>Additive to 1</li>
<li>Maybe talk through lemon example</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="lemonexampleoutcomes">Lemon example outcomes</h1>

<ul>
<li>Get and keep good car: 10, 0</li>
<li>Get and keep lemon: -5, 0</li>
<li>Get high price for good car: 5, 5</li>
<li>Get high price for lemon: 5, -5</li>
<li>Get low price for good car: 0, 10</li>
<li>Get low price for lemon: 0, 5</li>
<li>In equilibrium, accept all offers for lemon, reject for good car</li>
<li>So (roughly) would only ever make low offers</li>
<li>So would only offer to sell lemons</li>
<li>How does this extend to 3rd party buyer?</li>
</ul>
