# Three Conditions

* Mutual Responsiveness
* Commitment to joint activity
* Commitment to mutual support

Really needs last - otherwise competitive  activities are SCAs, and so is mob violence

# Can I intend that we F?

* Sure - I can intend to spend a sunny day at the beach, without intending the sunshine
* I can even, I think, do it without being 100% sure of the sunshine
* Don't need complete control

# Cooperative stability

* Is this right - do we have to have this?
* I guess so - driving around a roundabout is sort of like this
* Can be responsive - and intend that we both get by - and have no intent to support

# What exactly counts as coercion?

* Yes if I dictate the terms
* No, I guess, if I have limits - RickRolling example

# What does coercion stop

* Shared intention
* Or shared cooperative activity
* I don't know - feels a bit like joint intention still

# Explicit disavowal of commitment

* Discuss these for a bit
* Do they defeat shared intention; shared cooperative activity?
* Do they 

# Can we get commitment from elsewhere
 
* Typical case - assurances and responsibility to live up to assurances
* Big picture - let people know what game they are playing
* Let people rule out options
* This is a good thing to do
