Notes for 444, Feb 13

In book, K is a map onto a partition
	This implies K -> KK
	It also implies ~K -> K~K
	Go over these
	The first is controversial, the second is absurd because of false beliefs
	Maybe maybe cover margins of error

Multiple K operators
	What K1, K2, etc mean
	Helps to have each of them to be partitions I guess (I mean, makes computations easier)
	Three hats puzzle
	Also the children's game version of the puzzle

Anno's hat puzzle

Maybe one other common knowledge game
