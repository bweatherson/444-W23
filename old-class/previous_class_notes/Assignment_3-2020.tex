\subsection{Questions 1 to 3}\label{questions-1-to-3}}

Farad wants to go to law school so he's going to university to study
philosophy. He is deciding between Wisconsin and Minnesota.

Suppose 2/10 of Wisconsin philosophy students who apply to law school
get in, the rest go to teacher's college or medical school. For Farad,
going to law school has utility 250, and going to teacher's college or
medical school has utility 50.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  What is the expected utility of going to Wisconsin for Farad?
\end{enumerate}

Suppose Minnesota students have better odds of getting into law school:
3/10. And 6/10 go to work for the government, which Farad would prefer
to being unemployed. On the other hand, 1/10 of them don't get a job at
all, which has utility âˆ’50 for Farad.

Farad can't decide: Wisconsin and Minnesota seem equally good choices to
him.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  How much utility does working for the government have for Farad?
\end{enumerate}

Farad ends up going to Wisconsin and now he's about to graduate.
Unfortunately, his grades aren't as good as he'd hoped, so he would have
to do a special summer program to improve his odds of getting into law
school. Alternatively he can apply to medical school or teacher's
college, where he would definitely get in.

Farad has to choose between (i) taking the summer program, and (ii)
going to medical school or teacher's college. He won't have time to do
both. So if the summer program doesn't get him into law school, he'll
end up unemployed.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  How high would his chances of getting into law school have to be for
  him to risk taking the summer program?
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{question-4}{%
\subsection{Question 4}\label{question-4}}

Five percent of tablets made by the company Ixian have factory defects.
Ten percent of the tablets made by their competitor company Guild do. A
computer store buys 40\% of its tablets from Ixian, and 60\% from Guild.

Find \(\Pr(I | D)\), the probability a tablet from this store is made by
Ixian, given that it has a factory defect?

\hypertarget{question-5}{%
\subsection{Question 5}\label{question-5}}

In the city of Elizabeth, the neighbourhood of Southside has lots of
chemical plants. 2\% of Elizabeth's children live in Southside, and 14\%
of those children have been exposed to toxic levels of lead. Elsewhere
in the city, only 1\% of the children have toxic levels of exposure.

Find \(\Pr(S | L)\), the probability that a randomly chosen child from
Elizabeth who has toxic levels of lead exposure lives in Southside?

\hypertarget{question-6}{%
\subsection{Question 6}\label{question-6}}

The probability that Nasim will study for her test is 4/10. The
probability that she will pass, given that she studies, is 9/10. The
probability that she passes, given that she does not study, is 3/10.
What is the probability that she has studied, given that she passes?

\hypertarget{question-7}{%
\subsection{Question 7}\label{question-7}}

At the height of flu season, roughly 1 in every 100 people have the flu.
But some people don't show symptoms even when they have it: only half
the people who have the virus show symptoms.

Flu symptoms can also be caused by other things, like colds and
allergies. So about 1 in every 20 people who don't have the flu still
have flu-like symptoms.

If someone has flu-like symptoms at the height of flu season, what is
the probability that they actually have the flu?

\hypertarget{question-8}{%
\subsection{Question 8}\label{question-8}}

A magic shop sells two kinds of trick coins. The first kind are biased
towards heads: they come up heads 9 times out of 10 (the tosses are
independent). The second kind are biased towards tails: they comes up
tails 8 times out of 10 (tosses still independent). Half the coins are
the first kind, half are the second kind. But they don't label the
coins, so you have to experiment to find out which are which.

You pick a coin at random and flip it once. Given that it comes up
heads, what is the probability it's the first kind of coin?

\hypertarget{question-9}{%
\subsection{Question 9}\label{question-9}}

A company makes websites, always powered by one of three server
platforms: Bulldozer, Kumquat, or Penguin. Bulldozer crashes 1 out of
every 10 visits, Kumquat crashes 1 in 50 visits, and Penguin only
crashes 1 out of every 200 visits.

Half of the websites are run on Bulldozer, 30\% are run on Kumquat, and
20\% are run on Penguin.

You visit one of their sites for the first time and it crashes. What is
the probability it was run on Penguin?

\hypertarget{question-10}{%
\subsection{Question 10}\label{question-10}}

The Emperor Hotel has two kinds of suites: singles have one bed, royal
suites have three beds. There are 80 singles and 20 royals.

In a single, the probability of bed bugs is 1/100. But every additional
bed put in a suite doubles the chance of bed bugs.

If a suite is inspected at random and bed bugs are found, what is the
probability it's a royal?
