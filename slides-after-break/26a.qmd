# Density Functions

## PDF

Probability density functions are ways of expressing probabilities over continuous values.

- Example: Probability that we will get precipitation in such-and-such interval over the next 12 months.
- For any given number, probability that precipitation is exactly that is zero.
- But probability that we get between 30 and 36 inches of precipitation is an interesting number.

## Example

```{r cache=TRUE, fig.height=5}
require(tidyverse)
theme_set(theme_minimal())
ggplot(data.frame(x = c(20, 60)), aes(x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm,
                geom = "line",
                xlim = c(20, 60),
                 args = list(
                  mean = 39,
                  sd = 5
                )) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm,
                geom = "area",
                fill = "steelblue",
                xlim = c(30, 36),
                 args = list(
                  mean = 39,
                  sd = 5
                )) +
  xlim(20, 60) +
  labs(x = "Inches of precipitation in Ann Arbor in 2024")
```

## Question

What is the arithmetic mean of two PDFS?

- Answer: Just take the arithmetic mean of the value at each point.

## Question

What is the geometric mean of two PDFS?

- Possible answer: Take the geometric means of the value at each point and renormalise.
- Does that preserve the cool features of discrete geometric means? Not sure - hard question.

## How PDFs get used

- Step 1: Come up with the 'shape' of the density function, either by armchair reasoning or background knowledge.
- Step 2: Observe the target phenomena to set the parameter values.

## Normal Distribution

A common answer to step 1 is that the 'shape' should be the normal distribution. (Not going to go over what that is - it's in early stats classes.)

- Two parameters.
- First is mean - which is obvious.
- Second is standard deviation, which is _very roughly_ half the distance between the mean and values that would be _weird_.

## Cauchy distribution

```{r cache=TRUE, fig.height=5}
require(tidyverse)
theme_set(theme_minimal())
ggplot(data.frame(x = c(20, 60)), aes(x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dcauchy,
                geom = "line",
                xlim = c(20, 60),
                 args = list(
                  location = 39,
                  scale = 5
                )) +
  stat_function(fun = dcauchy,
                geom = "area",
                fill = "steelblue",
                xlim = c(30, 36),
                 args = list(
                  location = 39,
                  scale = 5
                )) +
  xlim(20, 60) +
  labs(x = "Inches of precipitation in Ann Arbor in 2024")
```

## Larger Tails

```{r cache=TRUE, fig.height=5}
require(tidyverse)
theme_set(theme_minimal())
ggplot(data.frame(x = c(20, 60)), aes(x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dcauchy,
                geom = "line",
                xlim = c(20, 60),
                 args = list(
                  location = 39,
                  scale = 4
                ),
                aes(color="red")
                )+
    stat_function(fun = dnorm,
                geom = "line",
                xlim = c(20, 60),
                 args = list(
                  mean = 39,
                  sd = 5
                ),
                aes(color="green")
                )+
  labs(x = "Inches of precipitation in Ann Arbor in 2024", col = "Shape of distribution") +
  scale_color_discrete(labels=c('Normal', 'Cauchy'))
```

## Problems

Sometimes the differences between shapes only show up in very rare cases.

- But those cases, like a pandemic, or a stock market crash, or a massive snow storm, are really practically important.
- If you see people talking about 'fat tails', that's what they mean.

# Potted History

## A Puzzle

Assume some people have non-probabilistic yes/no judgments on a bunch of propositions.

- Question: How do you get a group judgment?

## Obvious Answer

Majority Rule.

- The group believes _p_ iff a majority of members believe _p_.

## Problem 1

What to do with ties.

- Maybe that's ok, just neither belief nor disbelief.

## Problem 2

Leads to inconsistency.

- E.g., we each agree that precisely one team will win the playoffs, and the three of us disagree about which it is.

## Practical Consequence

This matters a lot in jurisprudence.

- When do judges decide on a question point by point, and when all at once.

## Philosophical History

Lots of detailed approaches, none of them particularly attractive.

- General thought (through 2000s), should just get people to state probabilities, those are easy to merge.
- Implicit thought: the merger is by arithmetic means.

# Sullivan et al

## Methods and Conclusions

- The conclusions of the Sullivan et al paper aren't very surprising.
- The 'wisdom of crowds' isn't very wise on politically charged matters, even when you measure it very carefully.
- But the methods are really interesting, and point to very interesting kinds of research.
- This includes both conceptual and empirical research.

## Methods

- Look at networks not just individuals.
- Focus on the asymmetric links in these networks.
- Use computer science tools to both analyse and investigate these networks.

# Networks

## A Brief History of Western Epistemology

- Dawn-of-time to 1990s: Epistemology is primarily about sense perception and inference. 
- 1990s-2010s: Testimony is really important too. 
- 2020s: And testimony isn't just a one-one relationship; it happens in networks.
 
I'm stressing *western* here because the relationship between testimony and other forms of knowledge is a very big deal in plenty of other philosophical traditions.

## Simple Testimony

- One speaker; one hearer.
- Two big questions.
- First, what prior knowledge does hearer have to have to get knowledge from speaker?
- Second, is there is something special about being spoken to, as opposed to overhearing?

## Network Testimony

- Breaks down the recipient/eavesdropper distinction.
- Is the TV news anchor talking to *you*?

## Network Testimony

- Cross-topic connections can start to matter.
- Is who you trust on vaccines related to what they say on climate change?

## Network Testimony

- If the network is a huge part of your contact with the world, what happens when the network 'chooses' to prioritise some information over others. 

## Some Empirical/Philosophical Questions

- Are networks with strong centers better or worse at getting/distributing/filtering information than networks with weak centers?
- What makes someone become central to a network?
- What happens when people use views on one topic to choose a network to trust on other topics?

## Jury Theorem

If you have a large bunch of people who make a judgment on a question, then the majority answer will almost certainly be right given the following constraints:

1. Each has a success probability greater than 0.5.
2. Each makes their judgment independently.

## Jury Theorem

- The first constraint doesn't always hold in real world cases.
- The second never does.
- Some work on how much it can be weakened, but it's a challenge to get much out of it.

## Real World Data

There are some impressive cases where this works though, especially on things that are not politically charged.

# Methods

## Real World Case

Sullivan et al use a real world case: Twitter posts about vaccines.

- Upside: Gotta say something about the actual world eventually.
- Downside: So much noise

## Asymmetric Networks

This adds a surprising amount to the computational complexity.

- But it does make for more realistic models.

## PageRank

- As you might know, PageRank was initially developed to power the Google search engine.
- But it's a very general mathematical construction, that can be used in any case where there are inbound and outbound links.
- And it makes sense in any case that the existence of those links indicates (sort of) trust.

## PageRank

- Most statistical programs these days have an implementation of PageRank built in to them.
- The math behind it isn't very sophisticated, but because of the iterative nature of it, actually doing the calculations can be time-consuming.
- But again, that's been optimised a lot in readily available software.

## Sentiment Analysis

- They use something called latent Dirichlet allocation to do this.
- I could talk all day about this if you want (quite literally - I wrote a book using this tool).
- It's a weird tool for this purpose.

## Sentiment Analysis circa 2023

- GPT rules everything.
- This is a remarkably good use case for it.
- It's less good than expert analysis, but better than non-expert analysis.
- And in studies I've seen, it's much closer to experts than non-experts.
