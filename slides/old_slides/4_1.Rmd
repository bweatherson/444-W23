## Plan

To discuss how we introduce uncertainty into the theory of games.

## Reading

Bonanno, section 4.1; the slide numbers and the section numbers have joined for now.

## Basic Idea

- Sometimes when a player has to make a choice, they know they are at one of a set of nodes in the tree, but they don't know which one.
- We will illustrate this by drawing a circle around the nodes.
- The circle means that the player making a choice knows that they are in that circle somewhere, but the rules of the game don't guarantee that they know which point they are in.

## Cheating Game

- Professor decides to either give every student the same exam, or give different exams to different students.
- Student doesn't know what professor did, and has to decide whether to copy off (known to be good at the course) neighbour.

## How To Read Tree

- Professor makes a choice.
- Then student makes a choice.
- When student chooses, there is a fact about where in the tree we are.
- But student isn't told that fact - they are just told that we are at one of the nodes in the circled set.

## Circles Everywhere

- We don't normally draw them, but you should imagine these circles everywhere on the tree.
- If a node doesn't have a circle around it, that means that its circle just contains itself.

## Information Set

- We will call the circle associate with each point its **information set**.
- Each node is in precisely one information set.
- That set may be a singleton; it might just be that node.
- But that's not the general case.

## Constraints on Information Sets - Outputs

Every node in an information set must have the same outputs.

- You can't have an information set where the Player has three options from one node, but only two from another.
- The player knows how many options they have.
- So if the options were different, they could figure out which node they were at.

## Constraints on Information Sets - Inputs

Every node in an information set has the same history of moves by the player whose turn it is.

- We assume everyone knows what moves they have made.
- It is an interesting fact that some real life board games rely on the falsity of this assumption.
- But as on previous slide, if the nodes have a different history for this player, that means the player knows which node they are at.

## For Next Time

- We will look at some assumptions about information sets that game theorists usually take for granted, but which seem philosophically problematic.
