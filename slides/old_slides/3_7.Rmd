## Plan

To discuss a remarkable result - that every turn taking zero sum game has a **value**.

## Reading

Bonanno, section 3.5

## The Class of Games Under Discussion

- Two-player
- Turn-taking
- Finite
- No hidden facts
- No randomness
- Zero-sum

That is a lot of restrictions, but it includes classic games like chess, checkers, go, othello and more.

## Theorem

Every one of these games has a **value**.

- The value of the game is an outcome that each player can guarantee that they get at least that good a result.
- Since the game is zero-sum, it follows that no player can guarantee that they do better.

## Proof Schema

- We prove this by induction on the nodes.
- The value of a terminal node is given by the definition.
- Say a penultimate node (at any stage of the process) is a node such that whatever move is made, the next node has a value.
- The value of that node is the best value of the subsequent nodes, by the lights of the player who has to play.
- So if player 1 has to play, and one nodes leads to a draw, and the other to Player 2 winning, the value of that node is draw.

## Proof Schema

- Since the game is finite, a finite number of steps of this process will assign a value to every node in the tree.
- So eventually the initial node will get a value.
- And that's the value of the game.
- And the way we've constructed that value shows that each player always has a path to ensure they never do worse.
- If it is their move, there will be a move that preserves value.
- And if it is the other players' move, the value is by definition the most harm they can do with that move.

## Consequences

- Consider any game with just two outcomes, one player wins or the other.
- Whatever the tree is, we know the table will have one of the following two features.

1. There is a row where every result is that Player 1 wins; or
2. There is a column where every result is that Player 2 wins.

## Consequences

> - In chess, at least one player has a strategy that guarantees not losing.
> - For some chess like games this is not a surprise - if player 2 had a winning strategy, player 1 could as it were execute it first. This isn't quite right for chess, but no one really thinks that player 2 has a winning strategy in chess.
> - Probably the value of chess is a draw, but this isn't known yet.
