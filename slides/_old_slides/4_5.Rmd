## Plan

To describe the notion of subgame perfect equilibrium.

## Reading

Bonanno, section 4.4.

## Definition

A set of strategies for each of the players is a subgame perfect equilibrium if and only if

- The set forms a Nash equilibrium.
- In every subgame, the set forms a Nash equilibrium.

## Subgame Perfect and Nash

The second clause is non-trivial.

- It rules out players doing certain kinds of odd things at nodes that are not reached.
- At subgame perfect equilibrium, each player's strategies make sense given the other player's strategies, and they are disposed to keep making sense under different assumptions about what they might do.

## Finding Subgame Perfect Equilibrium

- Find the minimal subgames.
- Act as if the initial node of that subgame is a terminal node, with its payouts being the equilibrium payouts of the subgame.
- If there are multiple equilibria, duplicate the tree enough times to cover each of them - you'll have multiple subgame perfect equilibria.
- Repeat until you've covered the whole tree.

## The right subgame

```{r}
game <- tribble(
  ~Moves, ~A, ~B,
  "e",  "1, 1", "2, 0",
  "f",  "2, 1", "0, 1"
)
gameformat(game)
```

- Player 2 is row
- Player 3 is column
- Player 1 is ignored, because they have no moves

## The right subgame with labeled best responses

```{r}
game <- tribble(
  ~Moves, ~A, ~B,
  "e",  "1, \\fbox{1}", "\\fbox{2}, 0",
  "f",  "\\fbox{2}, \\fbox{1}", "0, \\fbox{1}"
)
gameformat(game)
```

- Only Nash equilibrium is Player 1 plays $b$.

## Summary

So the subgame perfect equilibrium is:

- Player 1 plays $b, C$.
- Player 2 plays $d, f, F$.
- Player 3 plays $h, A$.

And the payouts are reverse order of their names: 3, 2, 1.

## For Next Time

We will start looking at games with cardinal utility.
