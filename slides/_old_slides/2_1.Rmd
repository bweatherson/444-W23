## Plan

- To introduce games!

## Associated Reading

Bonanno, section 2.1.

## Games

> - A **game** is any situation where the the outcome is determined by the actions of the players, plus perhaps some impact from the outside world.
> - If this seems really general, it is!

## Formal games

In a formal representation of a game we specify:

> - How many players there are.
> - How many moves they each have.
> - What order those moves get made in.
> - How many options they have at each move.
> - What the payoff is for each player for each possible combination of moves by the players and 'moves' by nature.

## Two Main Types

> - Each player makes 1 move, and these are made simultaneously.
> - Players take turns making moves, and every move is revealed to all players when they are made.

## Other Types

> - Nature gets involved.
> - Nature gets involved and their move is only revealed to one of the players.
> - A move made by a player is not revealed to the other player(s) straight away.
> - Multiple sequential moves.

## Positive Sum Game

- These instances are a bit non-representative in one crucial respect.
- They are all **zero-sum**.
- That is, someone doing well means someone else must be doing worse.
- This is not the general case.

## Positive Sum Game

Most of the games we're going to look at have the following characteristic.

- There is a pair of possible outcomes such that every player is better off in the first outcome than the second.

## For Next Time

We're going to get a bit clearer on what this last claim means, and how it affects how we write up games.
