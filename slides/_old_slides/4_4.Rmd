## Plan

To describe the notion of a subgame.

## Reading

Bonanno, section 4.3.

## Definition

Roughly, a subgame is a part of the game that could be a complete game.

## First Constraint

A subgame has an initial node.

- All nodes in the subgame are downstream of that node.
- Remember that in general, there is only one way to get to a node.

## Histories

So don't think of nodes as like positions in a chess game.

- You can get to the same position multiple ways.
- Rather, think of them as like the history of the moves.

## Second Constraint

The subgame consists of all the nodes downstream of that initial node.

- If $a$ is the initial node, and in the original game you can get from $a$ to $b$, then $b$ is in the subgame.

## Third Constraint

The subgame does not 'cut' any information sets.

- If $b$ is in the subgame, and $c$ is in the information set that includes $b$, then $c$ is in the subgame.

## Common Knowledge

Put another way, $a$ has to be a point such that when you get to it, it is common knowledge you are there.

- It being in a singleton information set is necessary for that (if not, the player who has to play doesn't know you are there) but not sufficient.

## Summing Up

- A subgame consists of all and only the points that are 'downstream' of some initial node.
- That initial node has to be such that if/when it is reached, it is common knowledge among the players that it is reached.

## For Next Time

- We will use this notion of a subgame to develop a new constraint on how to play games.
